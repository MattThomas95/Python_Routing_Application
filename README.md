# Python_Routing_Application

This application uses Python to sort and deliver packages by finding the shortest nearest neighbor.

The app first reads the .csv files containing the package info and delivery addresses.

Then sorts the packages by address and groups packages into one of three trucks.

As the packages leave the hub, their status is monitored and updated in real time.

Once a truck is empty it is returned to hub.

The application calulates distance traveled for all packages devlivered for the day.
